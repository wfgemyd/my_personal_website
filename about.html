            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

            <p>Born in Ukraine, my life's journey embarked on a new direction when my family moved to Israel in 2001. Embracing the vibrant culture and 
            spirit of my new home, I completed high school and embarked on a transformative journey in the Israeli military. Serving three years in the army, 
            particularly in the logistics department of a northern base, I learned not just discipline, but also the art of overcoming challenges through creative 
            problem-solving and the efficient management of large logistics operations. These experiences in the military laid a strong foundation for my 
            abilities in organization and strategic planning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After my military service, I pursued higher education with a steadfast dedication. At Technion University, Israel, I honed my skills in 
            Practical Engineering, graduating in 2020. My academic journey didn't pause there; it extended to the pursuit of a B.Sc. in Computing at Prague 
            City University. This blend of technical expertise and a contemporary British educational approach equipped me with the tools to lead and navigate 
            complex projects with strategic insight.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My journey also took a pivotal turn during the COVID-19 pandemic, where I embraced the role of a Project Manager. Here, I led significant initiatives 
            to support underprivileged families, orphans, and Holocaust survivors, deepening my commitment to social responsibility. This phase not only refined my 
            leadership and problem-solving skills but also ingrained a profound sense of duty towards community welfare.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently residing in Prague, <span id="age">26</span> years old, I am an Associate in Management Consulting at KPMG Czech Republic. In this role, I engage with a spectrum of clients, 
            navigating through complex business strategies and operational enhancements. Despite the rigors of a full-time career, my passion for lifelong learning keeps
             me engaged in advancing my academic qualifications, balancing work with weekend studies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As I look ahead, I am eager to transition into a more dynamic Project Manager role, leveraging my cumulative knowledge and experience. I aspire to 
            catalyze growth, spearhead innovative projects, and guide teams towards achieving exceptional outcomes. My career trajectory is not just a path of professional
             growth but a journey marked by a constant pursuit of excellence and a commitment to making a substantial impact in the management landscape.</p>

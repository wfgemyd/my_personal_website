            <p>
                As a Practical Engineer with a robust foundation in Project Management from Technion University, 
                Israel (Class of 2020), and an ongoing B.Sc. in Computing at Prague City University, I bring a blend of technical expertise and strategic insight to every project I undertake.
                 My journey, enriched by diverse experiences from leading social responsibility projects during the COVID-19 pandemic to a pivotal role in management consulting, has equipped me with unparalleled
                  leadership and problem-solving skills. Now based in Prague, I have transitioned from my role at KPMG Czech Republic to embrace the challenges and rewards of freelancing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my freelance career, I focus on leveraging my comprehensive skill set, including Full-Stack Development,
                 Project Management, and Client Communication, to deliver innovative solutions. My recent projects include developing a modern web application for a leading Dutch semiconductor company,
                  employing the PEVN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) to streamline their onboarding and ticketing processes. This endeavor not only showcased my technical prowess with JavaScript 
                  frameworks and open-source technologies but also my commitment to Agile methodologies and client satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my professional endeavors, I am deeply passionate about game development using Godot and GDScript,
                 exploring innovative projects using Raspberry Pi Zero, and continuously expanding my knowledge in the field of computing. 
                 With the completion of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science on the horizon, I am eager to further refine my skills.
                  My career is a testament to my relentless pursuit of excellence, dedication to lifelong learning, and ambition to make a significant impact in the industry.
